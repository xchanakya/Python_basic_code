#give all the tuples method and examples to understand tuples more easily
#Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.

tup=(1,2,3,4,5,5,7,8,9,10)
print(tup)

#count
print(tup.count(5))

#index
print(tup.index(5))
